# Elysia tRPC example
This repo is a demonstration of [Integrate tRPC with Elysia](
http://localhost:5173/blog/integrate-trpc-with-elysia.html).

As I want to keep things very simple, there's no mono repo usage here.

For more practical use, see a mono repo example of using Elysia Eden (no tRPC) at [Elysia Monorepo Example](https://github.com/SaltyAom/elysia-monorepo-example)

# Getting Started
To get started, open 2 terminals:
